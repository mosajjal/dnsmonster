# Dnsmonster

Passive DNS monitoring framework built on Golang. 
`dnsmonster` implements a packet sniffer for DNS traffic. It can accept traffic from a `pcap` file, a live interface or a `dnstap` socket, 
and can be used to index and store hundreds of thousands of DNS queries per second as it has shown to be capable of indexing 200k+ DNS queries per second on a commodity computer. It aims to be scalable, simple, and easy to use, and help
security teams to understand the details about an enterprise's DNS traffic. `dnsmonster` doesn't look to follow DNS conversations, rather it aims to index DNS packets as soon as they come in. It also doesn't aim to breach
the privacy of the end-users, with the ability to mask Layer 3 IPs (IPv4 and IPv6), enabling teams to perform trend analysis on aggregated data without being able to trace back the queries to an individual. [Blogpost](https://blog.n0p.me/dnsmonster/)

The code before version 1.x is considered beta quality and is subject to breaking changes. Please visit the release notes for each tag to see the list of breaking scenarios between each release, and how to mitigate potential data loss.

- built-in SIEM integration with Splunk and Microsoft Sentinel

# Installation

## Linux

Best way to get started with `dnsmonster` is to download the binary from the release section. The binary is statically built against `musl`, hence it should work out of the box for many distros. For `afpacket` support, you must use kernel 3.x+. Any modern Linux distribution (CentOS/RHEL 7+, Ubuntu 14.0.4.2+, Debian 7+) is shipped with a 3.x+ version so it should work out of the box. If your distro isn't working with the pre-compiled version, please submit an issue with the details, and build `dnsmonster` manually using this section [Build Manually](#build-manually).

### Container

Since `dnsmonster` uses raw packet capture funcationality, Docker/Podman daemon must grant the capability to the container

```
sudo docker run --rm -it --net=host --cap-add NET_RAW --cap-add NET_ADMIN --name dnsmonster ghcr.io/mosajjal/dnsmonster:latest --devName lo --stdoutOutputType=1
```


### Build manually

- with `libpcap`:
  Make sure you have `go`, `libpcap-devel` and `linux-headers` packages installed. The name of the packages might differ based on your distribution. After this, simply clone the repository and run `go build ./cmd/dnsmonster`

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mosajjal/dnsmonster --depth 1 /tmp/dnsmonster 
cd /tmp/dnsmonster
go get
go build -o dnsmonster ./cmd/dnsmonster
```

- without `libpcap`:
`dnsmonster` only uses one function from `libpcap`, and that's converting the `tcpdump`-style filters into BPF bytecode. If you can live with no BPF support, you can build `dnsmonster` without `libpcap`. Note that for any other platform, the packet capture falls back to `libpcap` so it becomes a hard dependency (*BSD, Windows, Darwin)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mosajjal/dnsmonster --depth 1 /tmp/dnsmonster 
cd /tmp/dnsmonster
go get
go build -o dnsmonster -tags nolibpcap ./cmd/dnsmonster
```

The above build also works on ARMv7 (RPi4) and AArch64.

### Build statically

If you have a copy of `libpcap.a`, you can build the statically link it to `dnsmonster` and build it fully statically. In the code below, please change `/root/libpcap-1.9.1/libpcap.a` to the location of your copy.

```
git clone https://github.com/mosajjal/dnsmonster --depth 1 /tmp/dnsmonster
cd /tmp/dnsmonster/
go get
go build --ldflags "-L /root/libpcap-1.9.1/libpcap.a -linkmode external -extldflags \"-I/usr/include/libnl3 -lnl-genl-3 -lnl-3 -static\"" -a -o dnsmonster ./cmd/dnsmonster
```

For more information on how the statically linked binary is created, take a look at [this](Dockerfile) Dockerfile.

## Windows

Bulding on Windows is much the same as Linux. Just make sure that you have `npcap`. Clone the repository (`--history 1` works), and run `go get` and `go build ./cmd/dnsmonster`

As mentioned, Windows release of the binary depends on [npcap](https://nmap.org/npcap/#download) to be installed. After installation, the binary should work out of the box. It's been tested in a Windows 10 environment and it executed without an issue. To find interface names to give `--devName` parameter and start sniffing, you'll need to do the following:

  - open cmd.exe as Administrator and run the following: `getmac.exe`, you'll see a table with your interfaces' MAC address and a Transport Name column with something like this: `\Device\Tcpip_{16000000-0000-0000-0000-145C4638064C}`
  - run `dnsmonster.exe` in `cmd.exe` like this:

```sh
dnsmonster.exe --devName \Device\NPF_{16000000-0000-0000-0000-145C4638064C}
```

Note that you must change `\Tcpip` from `getmac.exe` to `\NPF` and then pass it to `dnsmonster.exe`.

## FreeBSD and MacOS

Much the same as Linux and Windows, make sure you have `git`, `libpcap` and `go` installed, then follow the same instructions:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mosajjal/dnsmonster --depth 1 /tmp/dnsmonster 
cd /tmp/dnsmonster
go get
go build -o dnsmonster ./cmd/dnsmonster
```

# Architecture

## All-in-one Installation using Docker

![Basic AIO Diagram](static/dnsmonster-basic.svg)

In the example diagram, the egress/ingress of the DNS server traffic is captured, after that, an optional layer of packet aggregation is added before hitting the DNSMonster Server. The outbound data going out of DNS Servers is quite useful to perform cache and performance analysis on the DNS fleet. If an aggregator isn't available for you, you can have both TAPs connected directly to DNSMonster and have two DNSMonster Agents looking at the traffic. 

running `./autobuild.sh` creates multiple containers:

* multiple instances of `dnsmonster` to look at the traffic on any interface. Interface list will be prompted as part of `autobuild.sh`
* an instance of `clickhouse` to collect `dnsmonster`'s output and saves all the logs/data to a data and logs directory. Both will be prompted as part of `autobuild.sh`
* an instance of `grafana` looking at the `clickhouse` data with pre-built dashboard.

[//]: <> (end of command line options)

## Environment variables
all the flags can also be set via env variables. Keep in mind that the name of each parameter is always all upper case and the prefix for all the variables is "DNSMONSTER."

Example:

```shell
$ export DNSMONSTER_PORT=53
$ export DNSMONSTER_DEVNAME=lo
$ sudo -E dnsmonster
```

## Configuration file
you can run `dnsmonster` using the following command to use configuration file:

```shell
$ sudo dnsmonster --config=dnsmonster.ini

# Or you can use environment variables to set the configuration file path
$ export DNSMONSTER_CONFIG=dnsmonster.ini
$ sudo -E dnsmonster
```


## What's the retention policy

The default retention policy for the ClickHouse tables is set to 30 days. You can change the number by building the containers using `./autobuild.sh`. Since ClickHouse doesn't have an internal timestamp, the TTL will look at incoming packet's date in `pcap` files. So while importing old `pcap` files, ClickHouse may automatically start removing the data as they're being written and you won't see any actual data in your Grafana. To fix that, you can change TTL to a day older than your earliest packet inside the PCAP file. 

NOTE: to change a TTL at any point in time, you need to directly connect to the Clickhouse server using a `clickhouse` client and run the following SQL statement (this example changes it from 30 to 90 days):
```sql
ALTER TABLE DNS_LOG MODIFY TTL DnsDate + INTERVAL 90 DAY;`
```

NOTE: The above command only changes TTL for the raw DNS log data, which is the majority of your capacity consumption. To make sure that you adjust the TTL for every single aggregation table, you can run the following:

```sql
ALTER TABLE DNS_LOG MODIFY TTL DnsDate + INTERVAL 90 DAY;
ALTER TABLE `.inner.DNS_DOMAIN_COUNT` MODIFY TTL DnsDate + INTERVAL 90 DAY;
ALTER TABLE `.inner.DNS_DOMAIN_UNIQUE` MODIFY TTL DnsDate + INTERVAL 90 DAY;
ALTER TABLE `.inner.DNS_PROTOCOL` MODIFY TTL DnsDate + INTERVAL 90 DAY;
ALTER TABLE `.inner.DNS_GENERAL_AGGREGATIONS` MODIFY TTL DnsDate + INTERVAL 90 DAY;
ALTER TABLE `.inner.DNS_EDNS` MODIFY TTL DnsDate + INTERVAL 90 DAY;
ALTER TABLE `.inner.DNS_OPCODE` MODIFY TTL DnsDate + INTERVAL 90 DAY;
ALTER TABLE `.inner.DNS_TYPE` MODIFY TTL DnsDate + INTERVAL 90 DAY;
ALTER TABLE `.inner.DNS_CLASS` MODIFY TTL DnsDate + INTERVAL 90 DAY;
ALTER TABLE `.inner.DNS_RESPONSECODE` MODIFY TTL DnsDate + INTERVAL 90 DAY;
ALTER TABLE `.inner.DNS_SRCIP_MASK` MODIFY TTL DnsDate + INTERVAL 90 DAY;
```

UPDATE: in the latest version of `clickhouse`, the .inner tables don't have the same name as the corresponding aggregation views. To modify the TTL you have to find the table names in UUID format using `SHOW TABLES` and repeat the `ALTER` command with those UUIDs.

# Sampling and Skipping

## pre-process sampling
`dnsmonster` supports pre-processing sampling of packet using a simple parameter: `sampleRatio`. this parameter accepts a "ratio" value, like `1:2`. `1:2` means for each 2 packet that arrives, only process one of them (50% sampling). Note that this sampling happens AFTER `bpf` filters and not before. if you have an issue keeping up with the volume of your DNS traffic, you can set this to something like `2:10`, meaning 20% of the packets that pass your `bpf` filter, will be processed by `dnsmonster`. 

## skip domains
`dnsmonster` supports a post-processing domain skip list to avoid writing noisy, repetitive data to your Database. The domain skip list is a csv-formatted file, with only two columns: a string and a logic for that particular string. `dnsmonster` supports three logics: `prefix`, `suffix` and `fqdn`. `prefix` and `suffix` means that only the domains starting/ending with the mentioned string will be skipped to be written to DB. Note that since the process is being done on DNS questions, your string will most likely have a trailing `.` that needs to be included in your skip list row as well (take a look at [skipdomains.csv.sample](skipdomains.csv.sample) for a better view). You can also have a full FQDN match to avoid writing highly noisy FQDNs into your database.

## allow domains
`dnsmonster` has the concept of allowdomains, which helps building the detection if certain FQDNs, prefixes or suffixes are present in the DNS traffic. Given the fact that `dnsmonster` supports multiple output streams with different logic for each one, it's possible to collect all DNS traffic in ClickHouse, but collect only allowlist domains in stdout or in a file in the same instance of `dnsmonster`.

## SAMPLE in clickhouse SELECT queries
By default, the main tables created by [tables.sql](clickhouse/tables.sql) (`DNS_LOG`) file have the ability to sample down a result as needed, since each DNS question has a semi-unique UUID associated with it. For more information about SAMPLE queries in Clickhouse, please check out [this](https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/select/sample/) document.

# Supported Inputs
* Live capture via libpcap/ncap (Ethernet and raw IP are supported)
* Live capture via afpacket (Ethernet and raw IP are supported)
* Dnstap socket (listen mode)
* Pcap file (Ethernet frame)

NOTE: if your `pcap` file is captured by one of Linux's meta-interfaces (for example tcpdump -i any), dnsmonster won't be able to read the Ethernet frame off of it since it doesn't exist. you can use a tool like `tcprewrite` to convert the pcap file to Ethernet.

# Supported Outputs

* Clickhouse
* Kafka
* Elasticsearch
* Splunk HEC
* Stdout
* File
* Syslog (Linux Only)
* Microsoft Sentinel
* InfluxDB
