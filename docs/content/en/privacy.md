# Privacy Policy

## Overview

DNSMonster is an open-source passive DNS monitoring framework. This privacy policy explains how we handle data when you use our documentation website and the DNSMonster software.

## Documentation Website

### Information We Collect

This documentation website does not collect personal information. We do not use cookies, analytics, or tracking mechanisms.

### Third-Party Services

- **GitHub**: Our source code and documentation are hosted on GitHub. Please refer to [GitHub's Privacy Policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement) for information about their data practices.

## DNSMonster Software

### Privacy-First Design

DNSMonster is designed with privacy in mind:

- **IP Masking**: The software includes built-in functionality to mask Layer 3 IP addresses (both IPv4 and IPv6), preventing the tracing of DNS queries back to individual users.
- **Local Deployment**: DNSMonster is designed to be deployed within your own infrastructure. You have complete control over what data is collected and how it is stored.
- **No Data Collection by Us**: We (the DNSMonster developers) do not collect, store, or have access to any data processed by your DNSMonster installations.

### Your Responsibilities

When deploying DNSMonster, you are responsible for:

- Complying with applicable privacy laws and regulations in your jurisdiction
- Implementing appropriate data retention and deletion policies
- Ensuring proper access controls to DNS data
- Obtaining necessary consents for monitoring DNS traffic
- Configuring IP masking and other privacy features appropriately

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected in the documentation repository.
